    <h1>Privacy Policy for SpeedWarn.com</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: August 12, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>SpeedWarn.com ("we," "us," or "our") operates the SpeedWarn.com website and related mobile web application (collectively, the "Service"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the Service.</p>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" above. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Our Service is designed to prioritize your privacy. We do not collect or store personal information on our servers. All processing occurs locally on your device.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data</strong>: We access your device's GPS location solely to provide real-time alerts for nearby speed cameras. This data is processed on-device and is not transmitted to us or any third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: We may collect non-personal information such as your device type, browser version, and operating system to improve compatibility and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: Anonymous analytics (e.g., via local storage or opt-in tools) may track app interactions to enhance the Service, but no identifiable data is collected.</li>
        <li><strong>No Accounts or Profiles</strong>: We do not require user accounts, logins, or any form of personal identification.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or third-party analytics services that could identify you personally.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the Service, including generating alerts based on your location.</li>
        <li>To improve and customize the Service based on aggregated, anonymous usage patterns.</li>
        <li>To respond to your inquiries or support requests, if any.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. We may disclose information only if required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety, or the safety of others.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect any data processed on your device. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>6. International Users</h2>
    <p>The Service is hosted in the United States. If you access the Service from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where our servers are located.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or store personal data on our servers, there is no personal data for us to access, correct, or delete on your behalf. You can manage location permissions directly through your device settings.</p>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Links</h2>
    <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites (e.g., Stripe for payments). We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.</p>
